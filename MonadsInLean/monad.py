'''We just wrote a Monad! It's a useful code design tool that allows us to chain 
operations and abstract away busy work. Every monad has 3 things:
1) A wrapper type (intWithLogs)
2) A wrap funciton (wrapWithLogs) that wrap the data into the monad wrapper type
    The wrap function is often called "pure", "return", or "unit" - we'll see this later
3) A run function that runs transformations on wrapped values by unwrapping them.
    The run function is often called "bind", ">>=" or in lean, "do" '''
